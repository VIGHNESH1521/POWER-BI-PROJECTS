Mass shootings have become such a regular fixture on the news that it has been difficult to stay on top of each new incident. In fact, according to a recent article in the New York Times, there have been 26 mass shootings in summer 2019 alone, leaving 126 people dead. Of course, itâ€™s no secret that this type of violence is a problem in the United States, but there is no consensus about how to reduce the number of deaths by gun violence.
